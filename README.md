The project developed during the university course (Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico Lisboa) - Energy Services. 
The objective was to investigate machine learning capabilities in providing energy services like the analysis of electricity demand. 
The code was developed in Python language in the Google Colab notebook. 
The available input data was 2 years of electricity usage in the building and the weather data. The output of the model was visualized using the Dash tool.

9 different models were investigated:
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Regression Decision Tree
- Random Forect
- Random forest with uniformed data
- Gradient Boosting
- Extreme Gradient Boosting
- Bootstrapping 
- Neural Network

And evaluated using 4 different error metrics:
- MAE (mean absolute error)
- MSE (mean square error)
- RMSE (root mean square error)
- cvRMSE (coefficient of variation of the RMSD)
